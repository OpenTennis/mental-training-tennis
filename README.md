# Open Mental Training for Tennis 🎾🧠

Welcome to the **Open Mental Training** library — a free, open-source collection of guided mental exercises built specifically for tennis players.

Whether you're preparing for your next match or training between sessions, these tools are designed to help you develop match-ready instincts, resilience, and focus — **off the court**.

## 🔍 What's inside?

- 🎧 Mental imagery scripts (serve routines, pressure handling, etc.)
- 🧘 Breathing and pre-point routines
- 🎯 Focus and visualization drills
- 🧠 Dual-task concentration exercises

## 📦 Use Cases

## 🌱 Why Open Source?

This repository is part of [OffCourt](https://offcourt.app) — the first training system built entirely for what happens *off the court*. We believe serious amateur players deserve pro-level mental tools. That’s why we’re sharing the core frameworks openly.
